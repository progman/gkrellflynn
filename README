Flynn is a tiny system load meter for gkrellm. I've
picked this idea from Timm Mueller's Amiga application
which was derived from a windowmaker appicon.

Flynn is a guy who suffers from your activity, i.e.
the applications consuming precious processor time.
Hurt him plenty!

To make Flynn smile, just click onto his face.

Copyright notice: The program code is fully GPL
(see included licence) but the DOOM images are
owned by ID Software.

Portability issues: Since gkrellflynn uses /proc/stat
for CPU activity calculations this release is
limited to Linux.
